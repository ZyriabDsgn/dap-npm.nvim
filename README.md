Run your npm scripts from the debugger dialog

**This is a work in progress, readme will soon be here**

## TODO
- [x] Save already selected scripts and show them next time
- [ ] Kill process on session end
- [ ] Debug the sourcemaps jumps/messages (`outFiles`)
- [ ] Prevent debugger from starting if no script was chosen
- [ ] Add tests (͠≖ ͜ʖ͠≖)
